        <h1>Tables</h1>
        <h2>Important Info About Tables</h2>
        <p>Tables should only be used to layout actual data that belongs in a table. In the early days of the web, tables were used to create website layouts and themes, which worked, but is no longer the best practice today.</p>

        <h3>Table Basics</h3>
        <p>The <code><td></td></code> element represents a single cell in a table.</p>
        <p>The <code><tr></tr></code> element represents a row of cells in a table and groups a row of cells together.</p>
        <p>The <code><th></th></code> element represents a header of a group of cells in a table.</p>
        
        <p>To make this applicable, we will model our example table after the <a href="https://musicdataservices.com/" target="_blank">Music Data Services Pricing</a> table and add some headers to make the table data more clear.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Service Description</th>
                    <th>Pricing</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Conversion of data that the rights holder enters into our proprietary Excel template to CWR or DQI:</td>
                    <td>$10 plus $.05 per work in the file</td>
                </tr>  
                <tr>
                    <td>Conversion of data entered into our proprietary Excel template to CWR and DQI formats:	</td>
                    <td>$10 plus $.07 per work in the file</td>
                </tr> 

                <tr> 
                    <td>If the data that has been entered requires significant cleanup:	</td>
                    <td>$50/hour to prepare the Excel file for conversion</td>
                </tr> 

                <tr>
                    <td>If the user sends us a works list from a PRO or database and needs reformat and conversion:	</td>
                    <td>$75/hour</td>
                </tr> 
                <tr>
                    <td>Acknowledgement (ACK) file conversion to .csv:	</td>
                    <td>$15 per file</td>
                </tr>

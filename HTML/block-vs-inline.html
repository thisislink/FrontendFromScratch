      <h1>Block vs Inline Elements</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>How an element fits in with content flow of a document.</p>
      <h3>Block Elements</h3>
      <p>The element takes up the entire available space, hence, it takes up the entire block, even if there isn't enough content to fill the block.</p>

      <h3>Inline Element</h3>
      <p>These elements share space with other elements, such as an anchor tag. Two anchor tags (<a></a>) will be on the same block or line, but if you add an element that is by default a block element, such as an <h1>, the h1 will not share space with the anchor. The h1 will move to its own block line.</p>
